Bash script to replace text with emoji that contain appropiate letters, if possible.

Usage:
```
./text-to-emoji.sh "The most boring sentence in the world."
```

Requires basic stuff like bash (obviously), bc, awk, grep, cat and head.
You most likely have these installed already.

If you can run all of the above on Windows then the script will work there.
Otherwise nope.
